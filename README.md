You can download the latest Kiro ISO from [our SourceForge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kiro/files/).

**Kiro** is a customizable Arch Linux ISO builder based on the ArcoLinux project. It provides a simple way to build your own Arch-based installation medium with your choice of packages, settings, and scripts.

Kiro is my personal choice:

- uefi
- systemd-boot
- ext4
- sddm
- xfce4 and chadwm
- a lot of free software

## ðŸš€ Features

- Fully customizable build process
- Based on official Arch Linux tools and methodology
- GUI from https://github.com/calamares/calamares
- Script-driven: reproducible and automatable
- Modular structure for easy extension
- Lightweight and minimal by default

# Major changes after the videos on youtube

- Calamares moved from https://github.com/calamares/calamares to https://codeberg.org/Calamares/calamares - new pkgbuild
- kiro-system-installation package is no longer necessary and removed
- kiro-calamares-config has now several new modules replacing bash scripts

When studying the Buildra tutorial consider all the changes after the video and more will surely follow. 

Compare, compare and compare.
